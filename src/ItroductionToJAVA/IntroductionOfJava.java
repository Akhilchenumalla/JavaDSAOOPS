    How Java code Executes

    .java file --(compiler) -- .class file(byte code) --(interpreter)-- Machine code(o and 1)

     Java is platform independence
     -it means that byte code can run on all operating systems.
     -we need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand
     -compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executes code
     -this executable code is a set of instructions for the computer
     -after compiling c/c++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent
     -in java we get bytecode,JVM converts this to machine code
     - Java is platform -independent but JVM is platform dependent

     JDK VS JRE VS JVM VS JIT

     JDK
     - Provides environment to develop and run the java program

     JRE
     - it is an installatin package that provides environment to only run the program

     Java Sourcecode -- jdk -- bytecode -- jvm -- jre
