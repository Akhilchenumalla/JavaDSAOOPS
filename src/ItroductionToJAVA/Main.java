        /*Porecedual - specifies a series of well-structured steps and  procedures to compose a program.
                     -contains a systemic order of statements , functions and commands to complete a task

           Functional
           -writing a program only in pure functions i.e never modify variables , but only create new ones as an output.
           -Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ml
           -First class functions?


          object oriented
          -Revolves around objects
          -code+Data = object
          -Developed to make it easier to develop , debug , reuse and maintain software.

          Java is procedual and object oriented
          c is funtional language

          static language
          -perform type checking at compile time
          -errors will show at compile time
          -Declare datatype before you use it
          -more control

          Dynamic
          -perform type checking at runtime
          -error might not show till program is run
          -no need to declare datatype of variables
          -saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime

          There are two types of memories
          -stack
          -Heap
          a=10
          a is ref variable
          10 object
          a is stored in stack
          10 is stored in heap
          one object can have multiple variables

          Garbage collection means it collects the non reference variable
