        //System.out.println(56) here output is 56 because internally it calling by converting into String variable(toString)
        //System.out.println("kinal") same every thing we take it converts to string only
        //System.out.println(new int[]{1,2,3}) it gives random number for not get that we use Arrays.toString(obj)

        //System.out.printf("Formatted number is %.2f",a);
        //System.out.println("Kunal" +1) //output is kunal1 because 1 will convert into String by toString
        //System.out.println(""+new ArrayList<>());
        //to get any value we need to insert String in it to make output for example
        //System.out.println(new Integer(56 )+ new ArrayList<>()); it gives error
        //System.out.println(new Integer(56 )+""+ new ArrayList<>()); this gives output which is 56[]
        //-negative will not work in String

        //in String str.length() here length is function but in array.length here length is variable but
        // internally the same length only we apply both are same
